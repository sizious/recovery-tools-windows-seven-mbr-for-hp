Recovery Tools 4.0.1 Windows 7 MBR for HP: Language Switcher
********************************************************************************

In case of your target computer is localized in French language, you have the
possibility to set the Recovery Tools package in French.

To do that, just copy the content of the 'fr-fr' directory into the 'package' 
directory. To rollback, just copy the content of the 'en-us' directory and 
overwrite everything.

Of course, default is English.
